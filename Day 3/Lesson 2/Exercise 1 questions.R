# Exercise 1: Introduction to R Basics

# Task 1: Assigning values to variables
# Variables store data values
#Assign the following values: a=5, b=10, c=a+b. Print c.



# Task 2: Data types and data structures.
#2.1. Assign numeric, character, logic and factor values to variables. 


#2.2. Change the numeric variable into a character data type. Check to
#confirm the data type has been changed. Hint: class()


#2.3. Change the character variable into a numeric data type. What happens?
#Why do you think this happens?


# Task 3: Creating data structures
#3.1. Create a vector, matrix, list and data frame
# Vector

# Matrix

# List

# Data frame


#3.2. Convert your list into a data frame. View this new data frame.
